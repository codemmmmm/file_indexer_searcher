# File indexer and searcher

## Installation

* Download and change to the directory.
* Run the install script `sudo python3 install.py`. Python 3 is required.
* The directory may now be deleted.
* Some python libraries might be missing. Install the missing ones by running e.g. `pip install pyyaml'.
  *  Vanilla Ubuntu has been tested and requires no extra library. Vanilla Fedora Workstation requires the colorama and yaml python libraries.

The database and log path are saved in `/var/lib/file_index_search/config.yaml`.

# File indexer

Scans and saves all directory entries in a linux filesystem into a SQLite DB, except `/proc`, `/var`, `/run`, `/sys`, `/dev` and `/boot`.

## Database

The database saves:
* Entry path as MD5 hash
* Current time
* Entry name
* Entry file extension
* Entry type
* Entry path
* Entry path as placeholder
* Parent directory path
* Entry size
* Creation date
* Last modification date
* Entry owner
* Key as MD5 of entry path, creation date, last modification date and entry owner

## Usage

The first run, i.e. when the database is empty, will take much longer. If the log shows a "started" entry and no "finished" or error entry the application is still working.

### Native installation

Run `file_indexer` to start the indexing.

As a service:

* Replace line 6 in mindex.service with `ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "file_indexer"`.
* Copy the mindex.service and mindex.timer to `/etc/systemd/system`.
* Enable (and start) the service and timer. By default it will run 15 minutes after systemd start and every 12 hours after that.

### Installation as docker container

Run `docker run -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro --mount source=files-db,target="/etc/files-index" --mount type=bind,source="/",target="/host",readonly indexer` to start the indexing.

As a service:

* Copy the mindex.service and mindex.timer to `/etc/systemd/system`.
* Enable (and start) the service and timer. By default it will run 15 minutes after systemd start and every 12 hours after that.

# File searcher

Shows all files or directories that fit the name pattern from the database.

It prints:

* file path
* file type (this property should mostly be ignored because it isn't accurate)
* file size
* last modification date

## Usage

You can search the database either with a command line tool or with a GUI in your browser.

### Web-GUI in a container

Run `docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000/tcp --mount type=bind,source="/var/lib/docker/volumes/files-db/_data",target="/mysite_container/data" mmdockermmmm/file_search_gui` to use my [dockerhub image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mmdockermmmm/file_search_gui).

Replace the path in source="" with the **directory** path containing your database. The path is saved in the config file `/var/lib/file_index_search/config.yaml` created during the [installation](#installation).

Visit [localhost:8000/search](http://127.0.0.1:8000/search) in your browser to access the GUI. It runs as a Django development server.

To shut down the server run `docker stop container_ID` where container_ID is the string printed after using the `docker run` command. You can also get the container_ID by running `docker container ls`.

#### GUI

The pattern is matched with the SQLite [LIKE](https://sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#the_like_glob_regexp_and_match_operators) operator as "%pattern%". Case sensitive search currently is not possible.

After clicking the search button:

* Click on the table head fields (except "File type") to sort the table. You can only sort by one field at a time.
* Click on a "File path" field to copy the path to the clipboard.
* Hover over the charts at the top to expand them in size:
  * Chart showing the distribution of the system's files regarding their size (logarithmic axes).
  * Chart showing how many files have their last modification date in which year.
  * Chart showing which linux user ID owns how many files.
  * Chart showing the distribution of the file types (file extension) regarding the number of files.
  * Chart showing the distribution of the file types (file extension) regarding the size of files.

### Native installation

Run `file_search pattern` to search, replacing the pattern with a full file path or part of it.

The pattern is matched with the SQLite [LIKE](https://sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#the_like_glob_regexp_and_match_operators) operator, it can include "%" (any sequence of zero or more characters) and "\_" (any single character). It will automatically match as "%pattern%".

Optional arguments:

* -h, --help

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print the help message
* --minSize

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter by minimum file size (in bytes), inclusive comparison
* --maxSize

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter by maximum file size (in bytes), inclusive comparison
* --case

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enable case sensitive pattern matching

# TODO

## File indexer

* General optimizations and bug fixes
* Change the try for UnicodeEncodeError so that it doesn't just skip the entry (it currently is a workaround because it threw errors at multiple places)
* Make is_hidden() work for directories like /home/moritz/.mozilla
* Why are all entries counted as symlinks
* Make excluding /... directories optional
* Make exckuding hidden directories optional
* File extension field for directories should be null
* Get input from user to decide which directory to scan (in run command?)
* Check .is_dir() less often
* Maybe use os.walk() instead of own function
* Make it work for windows
* Where to save config files? https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/68721/where-should-user-configuration-files-go

## File searcher 

* add more search options
  * match exact pattern without %
* maybe: users can only see their own entries (uid)
* GUI
* analyzing: what file types (extension) take up how much space, recommend to remove old files

## GUI

* caching for images
* form should give option to exclude displaying directories
* replace "" with "no extension" in pie charts
* pattern matching can take % or _ as LIKE
* table to get the user name for every user id
* calendar plot/heatmap (make sure to print the number per day because the coloring can go wrong)
* sort pie charts again after adding "other"
* docs: describe where and how to e.g. add more plots etc
* IF NO FILE MATCHED THE PATTERN, PLOTS THROW ERROR?
  * also error if pattern is only whitespace
* make case sensitive search possible
